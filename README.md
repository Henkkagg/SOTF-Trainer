# sotf_hack
An injectable dll to add a few cheats to Sons of the Forest. Any injector should work, here's one by me: https://github.com/Henkkagg/loadlibrary_injector.

## Controls

H - Heals to full and gives immunity to next damage event

V - Gives full hydration

R - Gives full nutrition

U - Gives full rest

T - When you hold a throwable item, one more is added to the stack. Can be used multiple times

Z - Unhooks the input, basically deactivating the cheat (dll will still stay loaded)
