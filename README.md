# SOTF Trainer
An injectable dll to add the feeling of creative mode to Sons of the Forest. Unleash your creativity with endless wood, and never worry about your character getting tired again. Please don't use this in multiplayer.

Any injector should work, here's one by me: [https://github.com/Henkkagg/loadlibrary_injector](https://github.com/Henkkagg/DLL-Loader).

## Controls

H - Heals to full and gives immunity to next damage event

V - Gives full hydration

R - Gives full nutrition

U - Gives full rest

T - When you hold a stackable item, one more is added to the stack. Can be used multiple times

Z - Unhooks the input, basically deactivating the trainer (dll will still stay loaded)
